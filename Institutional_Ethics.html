                The intention of this section is not to give a design analysis on computer monitors, but to address the problem that is created when shopping for monitors. 
                Having worked as a Tech Sales Supervisor at Staples for some time, I spent a lot of time trying to guide customers who would often seem to be teetering with anxiety 
                having to think about choosing the perfect monitor out of a wall of fifteen bright screened monitors. If you aren’t someone looking for the most expensive and sleekest 
                looking monitor, I would have to spend a good chunk of time explaining all the specifications and differences between our monitors to customers who didn’t have a strong 
                tech background. My plan of attack when selling these monitors to customers, was to figure out the purpose a monitor would serve to them and highlight the key features 
                and design of a monitor that closely matched their needs. Here were some questions I would ask to get them started:

            <p style="font-style: italic;">“Are you looking for something cheaper or for more generic use? This could be for school, work, or general – everyday use.”</p>

                All these questions and more can help narrow down the features that aren’t always thought of when purchasing a monitor. For example, maybe your monitor 
                was going into your office room where you would get a lot of glare off a monitor that had a glossy screen, so you know you should look for a monitor with a 
                matte film on the screen. If you are gaming, you would have a much better experience on something that had a higher refresh rate or higher resolution. If you 
                have a small desk space, you should make sure you choose a monitor that would fit and has a small base. 
            </p>

                In our next section, we are going to discuss these key features and designs of monitors so that you can start narrowing down which monitor you should be looking for.
