			<h1 style="text-align:center;">Design Analysis on Computer Monitors</h1>
			<p>
                Computer monitors are seeing a dramatic rise in sales ever since the start of the Covid Pandemic. We see and hear about lots of people having to work remotely,
                and surely some have gone out and decided it’s time to get an external monitor or to upgrade their current one. I can speak for myself while having to spend a lot more time inside,
                though had a different excuse to upgrade an old monitor to a high-end gaming monitor (with covid came the increase demand for gaming and media consumption). The problem is, there are thousands of these monitors – hundreds of different brands – and an abysmal amount of 
                differently designed monitors suited for different needs. What design and type is best for your purchasing decision? The goal of this web page is to answer this question by giving a design analysis
                on the different types of monitors that exist today, and a more detailed breakdown of why I chose the monitor I recently purchased.
