            <h2>Matte Finished Screen</h2>
            <p>
                The screen of my monitor sh as opposed to a glossy finish. This helps prevent any glare since I have a decent amount of indirect sunlight that hits the screen. 
                Since the screen is also curved, any lighting emitted from the screen is not reflected on any other points of the screen – a small detaihas a matte finil that is particular in curved screens.

            <h2>Dimensions</h2>
            <p>
                The screens thickness is slightly less than an inch thick, and the depth of the base and screen (from left to right in the photo) is roughly 11 inches. This is rather wide 
                for a monitor and its base, however, fits perfectly on my desk since I have a decent amount of desk space. It would not optimally sit on a smaller desk space however since your mouse 
                and keyboard is placed in front of the monitor. Otherwise, the total width of the monitor when looking at the screen from the front, is roughly 28 inches which is wider than most monitors. 
                The height with the stand is 25 inches and the diagonal measurement of just the screen is 31.5 inches. This monitor is rather large but was chosen for that purpose, since I use it for 
                entertainment and multitasking. Since I was looking for a monitor that could comfortably fit multiple windows on the screen and would look like a small television for entertainment purposes, 
                the dimensions work well for my purpose. I would not have gotten such a large monitor if it wasn’t for these reasons.

            <h2>Speakers</h2>
            <p>
                My monitor happened to have been designed with speakers, albeit very small speakers fitted on the back of the monitor. As a result, the sound quality is poor and a 
                better design for them would have been to fit the speakers on the bottom of the monitor and facing towards me when looking at the screen. This placement would have made the 
                sound louder and clearer since the actual design sends the sound away from you. I decided to purchase a separate pair of speakers that for one sounds better, and is also louder 
                since I can choose which direction the sound is emitted. Another feature that would have been nice for the speakers is the ability to manually adjust the intensity of sound, such as a 
                physical knob or controls on the monitor to turn up the volume. If I decide to use the speakers on the monitor, I must go into my computer settings and turn up the volume – a slight inconvenience.

            <h2>Controls For Navigating Monitor Settings</h2>
            <p>
                The only physical button that is on the monitor is one to turn the power on or off. In order to access the monitors settings to adjust the brightness, 
                color profile, or inputs, the manufacturers decided to add a separate controller as shown in the image. I think this design works exquisitely well as the mapping 
                of all the buttons are an example of natural mapping and is intuitive as to what each button is meant to do. Lots of monitors don’t have any indicators that give the
                 user an idea of what each button is supposed to do, and I also have the ability to save preset color profiles (i.e. I can map low lighting settings to preset 1 on 
                 the controller, and high lighting settings to preset 2). This design enhances the usability of my monitor when I need to go into my monitors settings for any reason.

            <h2>Inputs and Connectivity</h2>
            <p>
                The inputs on my monitor allow for DisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA connections. The design and placement of the ports on this case make connecting anything into 
                these ports a complex task. The DisplayPort cord and many cords have clamps and a spring that need to be pressed in order to disconnect said cord (think of the old 30-pin cords 
                used to charge the first generation iPhone, you had to press buttons on both sides of the charging cord to disconnect it), and due to the positioning of these inputs on the monitor, 
                it is nearly impossible to disconnect these kinds of cords since it’s pressed against the casing. It is also hard to reach from under the monitor to connect any cord since you cannot 
                really flip the heavy monitor upside down, and the labeling/mapping for each input type is unreadable and too small of text. A better compromise in my opinion would have been to allow 
                the inputs to be plugged in from the top of the monitor or facing outward from the casing, and to have labeled the inputs further away from the ports.

            <p style="margin-left:80px; margin-right:80px; margin-bottom:20px;">
                This monitor supports 2560x1440 (2K) resolution and a refresh rate of 144Hz. While these aren’t part of the technical design of the monitor, 
                I would like to discuss how these impacted my decision on purchasing this monitor. Since my primary use of this was to be for entertainment and daily use, 
                and I wanted something mid-priced. I settled on 2k resolution since the screen is larger and curved, thus looking more visibly pleasing. The same goes for its refresh rate, 
                as it enhances the smoothness of videos and video games and allows for a more responsive feel when interacting with anything on my screen (as simple as moving a window across my screen or 
                opening files). These are features I would not care to have if I did not do these things on my computer, or just wanted to use for work or generic use.
